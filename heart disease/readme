numpy to make arrays
pandas to create dataframes(structured table)
sklearn train test split to split dataset to training and test data
accuracy score to evaluate the model

shape to find number of rows and columns
describe to find statistical details of data

Target variable
1: Defective heart
0: Healthy heart

dropping a columns axis=1 
dropping a row  axis=0

split data into training and test data
X_train contains features of training data
X_test contains features of test data
Y_train contains target of X_train
Y_test contains target of Y_train

test_size = how much % of data u want as test data
stratify = split the data in equal proportion (1,0) throughout training and test data
random state = split in specific manner

training the model:
fit() function tries to fit X_train and Y_train ie find pattern or relationship between features in X_train and corresponding target

evaluate the model:
use accuracy score

To build predictive system:
1. give input
2. convert input to numpy array: reshape so that model knows we are predicting for one sample
3. predict  output from given input using trained model
4. return prediction
